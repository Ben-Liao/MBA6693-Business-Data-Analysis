# Introduction
Write a program in Python in your respective folder on Deepnote to implement the ID3 decision tree algorithm using entropy and Gini metric. You should read in a csv dataset stored in a repository in your GitHub account.

Discuss the performance of the models developed by you.

Here are two sample datasets: Titanic 2 and Tennis

You can choose any one of these two datasets for your assignment or choose a dataset of your own.

Your file should be without any errors so that the entire code is executed with a single Run All Command.

Attach the ipynb file and paste the link to the deepnote notebook in comments while submitting.
